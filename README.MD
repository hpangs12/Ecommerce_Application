## Planned Updates:
- Implement Admin Pages.
- Replace the dummy implementation for the checkout feature.
- Perform Front-End code cleanup and possibly a design revamp.
- Implement the security feature for the front end and the API gateway.<br>
Note: Only security we have is the service methods querying the UserMS to validate the token for operations that require authentication.
